# MyProjects

This repository contains various experiments and small applications. The first module is a minimal Spring Boot backend for an e-commerce demo. It exposes sign-up, login and simple product APIs using in-memory storage.

## Modules

- **backend** â€“ Spring Boot service with user registration and product management.

## Running Tests

The backend uses Gradle. Run tests with:

```bash
cd backend
gradle test
```

> Note: Build may fail without internet access because Gradle needs to download dependencies.
