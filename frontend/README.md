# Frontend

This is a skeleton React application built with Vite. It includes stubs for an e-commerce UI such as product listing, cart, checkout and admin pages.

Dependencies are listed in `package.json`, but installation requires internet access. To set up locally you would normally run:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
